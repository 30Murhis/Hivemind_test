The dialogues you create with the VIDE Editor will be stored inside the Dialogues folder. These files contain all of the data required for your interface to work. 

It is adviced to keep back-ups of these files in a different folder outside the project. 

The dialogue files are interchangeable between projects, just make sure that they are inside the VIDE/Resources/Dialogues folder!
